        <b><u>Formation activities:</u></b>
        <p>This subject aims to give a global vision of Computer Engineering from a point of view
            fundamentally applied, given that the majority of topics are going to be developed with much greater
            depth throughout the grade. Furthermore, it is intended to contribute with this subject to the development
            of
            essential basic skills for a future engineer, such as the development of autonomy at work and
            learning or the ability to communicate, both oral and Scythian. For this reason, different types have been
            combined
            of activities and methodologies, both face-to-face (they take place in classrooms and other spaces, with the
            presence of the
            teacher) as non-face-to-face.</p>
        <p>
            The face-to-face activities have a high practical component, to promote greater learning through part of the
            student. They are the following:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Expository lesson:</b> the teacher will present the fundamental concepts of the subject, promoting
                the interaction with students, encouraging questions and debate around the topics presented.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Practical class and laboratory sessions:</b> they will be dedicated to the application, by the
                student, of the concepts seen in class to solve exercises and problems. In these classes, practices will
                be carried out both individually and in groups and will work on web projects.
            </li>
            <li><b>Work presentations:</b> presentation by students of some of the work carried out in the subject.</li>
            <li><b>Workshops:</b> two or three workshops will be held where transversal skills applied to
                cases and projects within the scope of the subject.</li>
            <li><b>Tutorials:</b> they may be individual or in groups, and are intended to clarify doubts and monitor
                the student.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The autonomous work required will be both individual and group. It will be used to prepare works, reading
            documentation, studying and preparing for exams. Consistency is very important self-employment and keeping
            work up to date. The work groups will be established from the beginning of the subject to promote work
            collaborative inside and outside the classroom. Group work will be carried out throughout the entire
            semester with different deliveries planned to have a formative evaluation throughout the course.<br>In order
            to facilitate the student's access to materials and planning their work, as well as the communication with
            the teacher and the rest of the students, the Virtual Classroom will be used, which is a online learning
            that offers different electronic resources to complement student learning.
