        <b><u>Technical description of the subject:</u></b>
        <p>The Fundamentals of Computer Engineering subject is designed to provide a global vision of the
            Computer Engineering, on the one hand as an academic discipline and, on the other, as a profession. It will
            allow the student
            know the foundations on which this engineering is based (mathematical, physical, anthropological and
            ethical), as well as the professional opportunities and the role that a computer engineer plays in today's
            society.</p>
        <p>The subject is divided into two parts: the first is dedicated to the theoretical foundations, and three are
            covered.
            blocks of fundamental content. The first addresses Computer Engineering in Society:
            Background and historical perspective: past, present and future of Computer Engineering. Engineering
            Computer science as an academic discipline or profession. The human factor: anthropological and ethical
            foundations. He
            The second block focuses on Information and Data: Representation of information. Organization of the
            information. To conclude, the last block deals with the Processing, Management and Transmission of the
            Information: Fundamentals, current paradigms and trends in systems and applications.
        </p>
        <p>The second part of the subject is dedicated to the development of practical skills. Throughout this part, the
            workshops where he presides over teamwork, preparation of printed documentation and presentations stand out.
            oral in public. A fundamental part is the laboratories where an introduction to web development is
            addressed, by carrying out a project to create a web page on content related to the subject.</p>
        <p>Apart from the technical skills, this subject aims to contribute to the development of certain
            basic capabilities for an engineer such as teamwork, ethical commitment and management skills
            both oral and written communication of technical information, favoring the comprehensive training of the
            engineer collected in the educational project of the university.
