By focusing on efficiency and technology, smart cities can become detached from personal and community interactions. Additionally, the isolation generated by excessive technology use can increase stress and anxiety.</li>
            <li>Difficulty of adoption: In some cases, adopting technologies and services in smart cities can be difficult and expensive. Some people or communities may not have the financial resources necessary to implement these technological solutions, which could create inequality in the adoption of smart cities.</li>
            <li>Absence of government commitment: Government commitment to smart cities can also be a problem. In some cases, governments may not be committed to implementing technological solutions in their cities, which could limit progress and impact on smart cities.</li>
            <li>Resistance to change: Society in general may also resist the shift towards smart cities. Individuals may feel uncomfortable or disconnected when changing to a society that is increasingly based on technology, which could make it difficult to adopt these solutions in cities.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>In summary, although smart cities have many advantages, they can also present disadvantages related to the technological aspect. Some of these disadvantages include loss of privacy, social distance, difficulty of adoption, absence of government commitment, and resistance to change. To address these disadvantages, it is important that smart cities develop policies and strategies that guarantee transparency, security, and citizen participation in the process of adopting technologies and services.</p>

        <u><b>The future of the tecnology</b></u>
    </div>
    <div class="content3">
        <img class="img15" src="../imagenes/img15.webp" alt="Imagen 15">
        <p>To face the changes that are presented to us, things are being proposed such as changing the energy model,
            the search for increasingly sustainable urban mobility, automation and improving information management and
            public infrastructure, among others. Great challenges that can only be achieved by betting on the two key
            elements of this so-called “4.0 revolution”: innovation and technology.</p>
        <p>Therefore, smart cities will attempt to achieve greater efficiency in their planning, use and management and
            greater interaction and quality of life for their citizens. They will undoubtedly have to bet on these
            implementations linked to sustainability, which will experience exponential growth in the coming years. And
            thus, implement solutions to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions by 20%, increase the quotas of renewable
            energy to 20% of consumption, or establish a minimum quota of 10% in the transportation sector, among
            others.</p>
        <p>But they will not be the only changes that are coming and that will help create more sustainable cities in
            the future. The growth of secondary raw materials industries, the rise of bioclimatic architecture, the
            development of Open Data platforms and the implementation of ICTs that facilitate smart government... all of
            them will be necessary changes, which are added to those already mentioned and which all smart cities will
            experiment in the coming years. </p>
        <p>Therefore, we can say that sustainability will be a value that is increasingly in demand by both governments
            and society, as well as a factor that will undoubtedly be taken into account when establishing increasingly
            restrictive laws. Therefore, the companies with the best reputation and best value, and those that will be
            worth investing in, will be the ones that adapt to these changes for a more sustainable future.</p>
