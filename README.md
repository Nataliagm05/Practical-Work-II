# Practical-Work-II
Description of your work:

To begin, I would like to say that this work has been done entirely by myself without any other reference page from which to take ideas or change information to make it mine. My website is a combination of everything I learned during my time in high school both in html, css and javascript, in addition to the expansion that I have currently acquired with this subject where I have been able to understand the terms and their uses well, therefore, I could To say that it is a quite personal page, made according to my tastes and. above all, knowledge.
On the other hand, if we talk about the technical form, this web page is made up of a main page, to which I have assigned the name index, where, from it we can go to the rest of the pages and links that we need: aboutme; topic; net; degree, from where we can access fundamentals; and finally, contact. All of them are united by the same CSS, in which I have tried to divide each characteristic by page, and I have tried to use all the models proposed in the syllabus. It should be said that on each page there are links to go to the rest of them or return to the main page from which you start. Each one has its own design, an example of how I would like a website and also a clear and precise presentation with all the required and necessary information.

Starting with the Index, on this page we find a brief description of the pages that we can access from it through a series of icons, which if we click will take us to that page.

Continuing with About me, here we can see how the different icons associated with the rest of the pages appear, referring to the main page with the icon assigned to each one, and also the one for the main page and the contact as separate icons. We also find some arrows where by clicking we can change the photo, along with this we find a brief description based on unit 2 and 3 about me, the person who created the page. Below this we find the links to my social networks, whether we click on the image or if we click on the user. And finally, the curriculum vitae based on all my real-life courses and my work on them, in addition to the academic training I have so far.

The next would be the topic, in which I have put practical work 1 trying to improve with the corrections of this and changing what is wrong, in addition to photos related to what is being talked about and a small reference to the pages from which I took all the information. information to do my part of the work, which is what I have put in.

We also find Net, in which we see the different links to the pages of my colleagues, whom I have organized in list order from left to right.

Continuing with Degree, we see the different courses to which I must advance, to open these we must click on them and only the clicked one will open, while the others will remain below the table to be opened in order and they will not close until that you yourself press the same selected course again. In this we find hidden the link to the page of the explanation of this subject, we find this in the first course by clicking on the name of the subject. From this page we can also return to the rest of the pages, but it can only be accessed through the degree page. In this we find the explanation of the subject as proposed by the university and at the end I have made a small opinion as a student about it.

Finally, we find contact, where we can find the different boxes to fill in if we have any suggestion, complaint or problem about the page, in these we must put the data in the boxes that must be filled in as indicated in the alert, which only It remembers it once since if they are sent empty nothing will be sent. Once filled out, everything will be sent directly when you press the send button and it will take you directly to the home page so you can continue enjoying my website.

Problems during the development:

An important factor in building a successful website is knowledge of CSS and how to implement new features at work. During this project, I experienced challenges learning new CSS features, which resulted in increased effort to complete the work.

In terms of page organization, I found adjusting the layout and layout of the photos to be a laborious process. However, I managed to adapt and accept that the learning process is constant and dynamic.

To solve the problem of changing photos with arrows, I implemented JavaScript as a workaround. Although I initially resisted using JavaScript, I eventually realized that it is a powerful tool that can tackle complex problems like this.

In summary, my biggest challenge in this project was learning and implementing new CSS features, as well as page organization and layout. However, facing these challenges and learning from them has been a valuable and educational process. As I continue to develop my skills and knowledge in web design, I will be better prepared to face new challenges and find creative and innovative solutions.

Conclusions:

Throughout this project, I have discovered that I am able to learn and adapt to new languages ​​and tools. Through constant practice, I have developed solid skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

My experience on this project has shown that it is essential to research and learn from the people and resources that surround our profession. I have learned to value the opinions and advice of those with more experience, and I have worked on developing effective communication skills to ask questions and find solutions to problems.

I have also discovered that it is essential to maintain a positive and proactive attitude, and to be willing to take risks and mistakes as learning opportunities. This attitude has allowed me to quickly adapt to new languages ​​and tools, and has opened doors to future opportunities.

In short, this project has provided me with an enriching experience that has left a lasting legacy. As I delve into the field of web development, I hope to continue using these skills and attitudes to continue growing and developing.
